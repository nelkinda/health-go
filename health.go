// Package health provides an implementation of the upcoming RFC Health Check Response Format for HTTP APIs.
// To use it, ask health to create a new http.Handler and add it to your server.
// While doing so, you can add information about the service and optionally providers for Checks.
//
// Example:
//  package main
//
//  import (
//  	"github.com/nelkinda/health-go"
//  	"github.com/nelkinda/health-go/checks/uptime"
//  	"net/http"
//  )
//
//  func main() {
//  	h := health.New(
//  		health.Health{
//  			Version: "1",
//  			ReleaseId: "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT",
//  		},
//  		uptime.System(),
//  		uptime.Process(),
//  	)
//  	http.HandleFunc("/health", h.Handler)
//  	http.ListenAndServe(":80", nil)
//  }

// Status represents a health status.
// Possible values are pass, warn, and fail.
type Status string

// Health Check Response Format for HTTP APIs uses JSON format described in RFC 8259 and has the media type "application/health+json".
// Its content consists of a single mandatory root field ("status") and several optional fields:
// See https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-inadarei-api-health-check-04.html#section-3
type Health struct {

	// status: (required) indicates whether the service status is acceptable or not.
	// API publishers SHOULD use following values for the field:
	// * "pass": healthy (acceptable aliases: "ok" to support Node's Terminus and "up" for Java's SpringBoot),
	// * "fail": unhealthy (acceptable aliases: "error" to support Node's Terminus and "down" for Java's SpringBoot),
	//   and
	// * "warn": healthy, with some concerns.
	//
	// The value of the status field is case-insensitive and tightly related with the HTTP response code returned by the health endpoint.
	// For "pass" and "warn" statuses, HTTP response code in the 2xx-3xx range MUST be used.
	// For "fail" status, HTTP response code in the 4xx-5xx range MUST be used.
	// In case of "warn" status, endpoints MUST return HTTP status in the 2xx-3xx range, and additional information SHOULD be provided, utilizing optional fields of the response.
	//
	// A health endpoint is only meaningful in the context of the component it indicates the health of.
	// It has no other meaning or purpose.
	// As such, its health is a conduit to the health of the component.
	// Clients SHOULD assume that the HTTP response code returned by the health endpoint is applicable to the entire component (e.g. a larger API or a microservice).
	// This is compatible with the behavior that current infrastructural tooling expects: load-balancers, service discoveries and others, utilizing health-checks.
	// See https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-inadarei-api-health-check-04.html#section-3.1
	Status Status `json:"status" example:"pass"`

	// version: (optional) public version of the service
	// See https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-inadarei-api-health-check-04.html#section-3.2
	Version string `json:"version,omitempty" example:"1"`

	// releaseId: (optional) in well-designed APIs, backwards-compatible changes in the service should not update a version number.
	// APIs usually change their version number as infrequently as possible, to preserve stable interface.
	// However, implementation of an API may change much more frequently, which leads to the importance of having separate "release number" or "releaseID" that is different from the public version of the API.
	// See https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-inadarei-api-health-check-04.html#section-3.3

// The Checks Object
// The "checks" object MAY have a number of unique keys, one for each logical downstream dependency or sub-component.
// Since each sub-component may be backed by several nodes with varying health statuses, these keys point to arrays of objects.
// In case of a single-node sub-component (or if presence of nodes is not relevant), a single-element array SHOULD be used as the value, for consistency.
//
// The key identifying an element in the object SHOULD be a unique string within the details section.
// It MAY have two parts: "{componentName}:{measurementName}", in which case the meaning of the parts SHOULD be as follows:
// o componentName: (optional) human-readable name for the component.
//   MUST not contain a colon, in the name, since colon is used as a separator.
// o measurementName: (optional) name of the measurement type (a data point type) that the status is reported for.
//   MUST not contain a colon, in the name, since colon is used as a separator.
//   The observation's name can be one of:
//   * A pre-defined value from this spec.
//     Pre-defined values include:
//     + utilization
//     + responseTime
//     + connections
//     + uptime
//   * A common and standard term from a well-known source such as schema.org, IANA or microformats.
//   * A URI that indicates extra semantics and processing rules that MAY be provided by a resource at the other end of the URI.
//     URIs do not have to be dereferenceable, however.
//     They are just a namespace, and the meaning of a namespace CAN be provided by any convenient means (e.g. publishing an RFC, Swagger document or a nicely printed book).
// See https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-inadarei-api-health-check-04.html#section-4
